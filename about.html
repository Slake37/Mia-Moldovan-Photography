                <p>I’m Mia, a pasionate photographer based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. I’ve been living in Newcastle for almost 7 years and I love it. I love the surroundings and people, which are very welcoming and sensible. I have always been pasionate about photography since I was a child. Coming to UK in 2014 and working as a Registered Nurse, opened my eyes to reality, refinding myself again into the arms of photography, creativity and imagination. I love working with people. I love reading, travelling and meeting new people and places. I’m a openminded person, love to see my clients be comfortable, having a good time during sessions and not being nervous in front of the camera.</p>
